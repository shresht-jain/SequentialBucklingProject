Raw data underlying the figures in the main text are provided as Excel files in this folder.

Data for Figures 1A–B, 2A–B, and 3A–G are organized by figure number, with individual sheets corresponding to each subpanel. 

Figure 1A is an image montage and has no associated numerical data. 

For Figure 1B, which is an imagesc representation of spatiotemporal profiles, the Excel file contains the corresponding X- and Y-coordinate grids and the colour-scale data. 
Colormap "-roma" from the Crameri package were used for visualisation.

For Figure 2A and its inset we provide the strain (eps) and force (in Newtons) for all experiments.
For Figure 2B, we provide the results from the experiments incluidng the wavelengths (mm),geometry information and errors (mm), as well as for the simulations we prvide the geometry parameters (sqrt(RT)) as well as the wavelengths in mm.
